* I'm Hugo Bitencourt (@hugovynicius)

* I'm a Software Engineer and Data Scientist with over ten years of professional experience and an academic background, including a Ph.D. in Computational Intelligence, a Master’s degree in Microelectronics and Microsystems, and a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems.

* My career bridges research in computational intelligence/artificial intelligence with real-world software engineering, enabling me to design, implement, and deploy scalable, data-driven systems in production environments.

* My doctoral research focused on predictive methods for IoT and renewable energy systems, fuzzy time series models, dimensionality reduction techniques, and the development of new forecasting algorithms, including open-source contributions.

* More recently, my research has expanded to foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to time series analysis, improving accuracy, robustness, and cross-domain generalization.
